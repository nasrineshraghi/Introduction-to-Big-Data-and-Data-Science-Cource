In this course, students will understand the data science workflow and big data concepts and tools.
Data science workflow consists of six main steps: data collection, data access, data storage, data preprocessing, data visualization and data analysis and machine learning.
in the end, we will work with a big data pipeline and handle a large amount of data with Spark, specifically Pyspark in Python.
