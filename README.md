# Introduction-to-Big-Data-and-Data-Science-Course

In this course, students will understand the data science workflow and big data concepts and tools.
Data science workflow consists of six main steps: data collection, data access, data storage, data preprocessing, data visualization and data analysis with machine learning.
In the end, they work with a big data pipeline and handle a large amount of data with Spark, specifically Pyspark in Python.

During this course, they will learn different Python libraries for data science such as Pandas, Mathplotlib, Numpy, Geopandas, Request, Pyspark and TensorFlow.
